### **IoT Temperature Monitoring System**  

This project utilizes an **Arduino board** to collect real-time **temperature data** using a sensor. The data is then transmitted to a **Raspberry Pi**, which processes and stores it in a **CSV file** for further analysis. This system enables efficient data logging and can be expanded for various IoT applications.  

**Technologies Used:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Sensors, CSV Data Processing, Serial Communication.
